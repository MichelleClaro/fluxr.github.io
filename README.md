# FreshBooks Research Guide
A simple guide to help learn our Lean UX Research processes and best Practices at FreshBooks - http://research.freshbooks.com/

### What is UX Research?
Most projects start with an idea â€” a hypothesis of a problem customers have, that you can solve. How do you turn that into an end product that people love? Research helps improve our understanding, and inform our product decisions.

At FreshBooks, we leave no assumption untested. We use a variety of lean research methods to fill in the knowledge gaps to ensure what we decide to build solves real needs for our customers.
